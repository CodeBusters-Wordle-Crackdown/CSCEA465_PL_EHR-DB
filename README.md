# SQL Injection Attack & Defense on an EHR Database  

## Project Overview  
This project simulates an **SQL injection attack** on a centralized **Electronic Health Record (EHR) database**, evaluates vulnerabilities, and implements security measures to defend against them. The goal is to demonstrate real-world cybersecurity threats and best practices in database security.  

## Team Roles  
- **Team Lead:** Constantine Hinds 
  - Dynamic role â€“ supports all teams as needed  
- **Defensive Team:** Nicasio and Gwen
  - Designs and implements a simple database with patient records and user authentication.   
  - Implement security measures to prevent SQL injection, such as input validation, prepared statements, and encryption.  
- **Offensive Team: Clint and Constantine** 
  - Conducts **three rounds of SQL injection attacks**, refining techniques and exposing vulnerabilities after each round.  

## Project Timeline  
| Date | Task |
|------|------|
| **Feb 19-21** | Finalize database design, confirm roles, set up GitHub repository. |
| **Feb 22-27** | Initial implementation: database setup, security mechanisms, and offensive strategy formulation. |
| **Feb 28 @ 7 PM** | Initial implementation must be completed for testing. |
| **Feb 28 - Mar 1** | Three rounds of SQL injection attacks and defense improvements. Data recorded after each round. |
| **Mar 4 or 6** | Project demonstration. |
| **Mar 5** | Final revisions and documentation completion. |
| **Mar 7 @ 1 PM** | Submission deadline. |

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Database:** SQLite (or other team choice)  
- **Programming Languages:** Python, Java, C++, or others (team preference)  
- **Security Measures:** Input sanitization, prepared statements, encryption  
- **Version Control:** GitHub for collaboration and tracking progress  

## Execution Plan  
1. **Database Implementation** (Feb 19-27)  
   - Design and deploy the database with at least **five simulated patient records** and user authentication.  
   - Once completed, database team members shift to the **Defense Team**.  

2. **Security & Attack Preparation** (Feb 22-27)  
   - Defensive team implements **security best practices** to protect against SQL injection.  
   - Offensive team researches and prepares attack strategies.  

3. **SQL Injection Attack Rounds & Defense Adjustments** (Feb 28 - Mar 3)  
   - Conduct **three rounds** of attacks.  
   - Record vulnerabilities and adjust defenses between each round.  

4. **Final Revisions & Demo Prep** (Feb 28- Mar 3)  
   - Refine implementation, finalize documentation, and prepare for the demo.  

5. **Submission** (Mar 7, 1 PM AKST)  
   - Each team member submits an **individual report** detailing contributions and code commits.  

## Deliverables  
- **GitHub Repository**: Contains attack and defense implementations.  
- **Documentation**: Detailed logs of attack strategies and security responses.  
- **Demo**: Live demonstration of SQL injection attacks and defenses.  
- **Individual Reports**: Each member documents their contributions for submission.  

## Collaboration Guidelines  
- **Meetings**: Weekly team meetings (plus sub-team meetings as needed).  
- **GitHub Usage**:  
  - Commit changes frequently.  
  - Use meaningful commit messages.  
  - Follow proper branching and pull request procedures.  
- **Communication**: Regular updates on progress and blockers.
